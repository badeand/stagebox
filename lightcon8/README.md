## Lessons learned

### Board

- use both GND and GNDBREAK on the dc power jacks
- use correct hole size for the dc power jacks - check pins on dc power jacks
- The USB on microchips should be placed at the end of the board to make it easier to design case
- make a rough plan of the case before ordering
- make sure that the mounting holes are usable for the case

### 3D version of the board

- use PDF as transfer from Fritzing to Fusion. Convert file with Illustrator

### Case

- doublecheck mounting holdes. do a sanity check to avoid stupid errors
- include slots for air
- for indicator LED, check the actual lenth of the LED to make sure the LED will flush with the case
- Remember to make room for solder on the back of the board
